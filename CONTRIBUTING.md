# How to contribute to the Easy Godot Features Plugin

*This contribution document was based on the [Ruby on Rails contribution's page](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Some of the sentences were ripped from there, as I liked the simple structure of their contribution page.*

## Did you find a bug?

- Have a glance at the issues tab to see if the bug has already been found.
  - If you find it, please continue the conversation there with your findings.
  - Please don't write "same here"/"me too" sorts of messages; leave an emoji on the issue if you want to express that the bug could be replicated on your end, too.
- If the bug is not reported, open a new issue, and let us know the details of it.
  - The most important details are the bug description, steps to duplicate the bug, the current result caused by the bug, the expected result after the solution, and if you can, add a video, GIF, or image.

## Did you write a fix for a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Important notes before you create your PR

- We use the `gdformat` for formatting GDScript files, which is included in the `gdtoolkit` Python package.
  - If your code is not formatted with `gdformat`, your changes will not be accepted.

## Do you want to add a new functionality or change an existing one?

- Before adding a new feature, create an issue for the feature request to collect feedback on your idea.
  - Only get started working on the issue if a project manager/contributor gives you the green light or your issue has 80% positive feedback with at least 5 people responding to your idea.
 
## Do you have a new feature or template to add to the project?

- Same as before, open a new issue on this repository, and we'll create the repository for the new feature and/or template.
  - If you already have the code, you can PR it to the newly created repository.
 
## Would you happen to have questions about the source code?

*Currently, this section is a work in progress. We intend to add a documentation folder and a Discord server for discussion. Sorry to keep you waiting!*
