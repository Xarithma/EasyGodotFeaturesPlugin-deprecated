# Welcome! This is the Easy Godot Features Addon

**A place where we make game development simpler.**

## The addon

Here's a project summary; you can read it if you'd like to contribute.

### What does this project do?

There are three things this project aims to help game developers with:

- Integration of third-party tools into your projects. (For example: Steam support)
- Integration of complex features. (For example: Networking)
- Bootstarting new projects with templates.

While Godot provides an excellent developer experience, some game development aspects
still need improvement. There might be crucial elements that require a lot of
planning and thinking to get to the best practices, and a lousy configuration might
even harm gameplay for the players.

This is what this project aims to fix. Providing modularity to the features it
offers clean code if customization is needed and a clean framework to extend
many of its functionality.

### Why Godot and not [insert popular engine here]

I aim to bring an open-source tool to an open-source tool. While there are a lot of
significant open-source engines on the market, Godot is probably the most extendable, with
GDScript. If somebody wants to look at the plugin's code and modify it, they
can do so with the same language they make games with.

Godot also brought together a lot of open-source supporters, a group which I completely
associate with, and would love to get more, possibly even with this project.

### What's ahead for now?

While I know some things about making games with Godot, making addons/plugins is
something I have never done, so I am learning the ropes as I am developing this project

We are in the proof of concept phase, and these are the features I want the tool to have:

- Steam integration support
- Third-person (3D) project template (networked/local)
- First-person (3D) project template (networked/local)
- Top-down view (3D) project template (networked/local)

## How to install?

**Warning:** We still need Godot asset store support.

1. Clone the repository
2. Place the addon folder into the root of your project's folder.
3. Go to Project Settings -> Plugins and enable the plugin

If everything is correct, the dock on the left side of the screen should appear. (WIP)

## How to use the project?

**This section is a work in progress, as the best practices still need to be developed.**
